## My Development Process

I focus on clean, maintainable code and user-centric design. Hereâ€™s how I approach app development:

1. **Planning**: I start by defining the app's core functionality and features, keeping the user experience at the forefront.
2. **UI/UX Design**: I create prototypes and mockups to design the app's flow and ensure a seamless experience.
3. **Development**: I build the app using Flutter and Dart, integrating third-party packages or APIs (such as Firebase and other services) where needed.
4. **Testing & Debugging**: I thoroughly test my apps to identify and fix any bugs or performance issues.
5. **Deployment**: I deploy the apps for use on both Android and iOS platforms.
